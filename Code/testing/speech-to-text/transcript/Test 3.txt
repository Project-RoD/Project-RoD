Chapter 1, loomings. Call me Ishmael. Some years ago, never mind how long precisely, I've been little or no money in my purse and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail a little and see the watery parts of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the month, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul, whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before a coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet, and especially whenever much my high post gets such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people's hats off, then I account at high time to get to see as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball, with a philosophical flourish, Kato throws himself upon his sword, I quietly take to the ship. There's nothing surprising in this, if they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, sometime or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
